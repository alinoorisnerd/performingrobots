## 09/02/2025 - Fixing the Robot base and body frame:

Today was a quite long day. After trying to get around the problem of one of the motors not spinning and working according to program structure, the board and circuit installment including arduino was tested for short circuit. Towards the end the fault was found inside the Arduino board which was later swapped.

The Next step was to build a 1.5 Metre long body with physical characterics to the robot. The wooden plank from Alpine wood was used to build the backbone of the frame, and a lot of sawing, cutting, and drilling was done to manufacture the robot as we advised. Nails were driven into the long plank to attach it to wooden base, and l-brackets were made use of to provide arching support to the plank.

The final project ended up looking like this:

Overall the robot works as of now in terms of its control;however, the code still requires some adjustment to properly map the input from the controller onto the wheels attached below the base.


## 09/03/2025 - Completing the upper body, alongside face and shoulders:

Today the upper body was the primary target. To acheive this, we needed the shoulder. Hence, a small light weight plank was cut and then was joint to the already existing spine of the character, with nails driven though them.

 To make sure the character isn't tilting, the level was checked and was made sure that no tilt occured.

 After this, the face of the character (Walter White ) was cut-out to be place on the robot. I printed the face and then used cardboard as foundation. Using sharp blade, the cutout of the husband was obtained.

 After this, the shredded body was the next on the agenda. Same procedure as the face was replicated and a defined front and back was made.

Towards the end, we had a semi-realistic character coming along !

## 09/07/2025 - Completing the arms and fore-arms of the robot:
Today's class was short and concise. The arms and forearms of the robot were on today's agenda. The robot was planned to have movement along y-axis only, however; I decided to incorporate a y-axis 2 dimensional movement as well. For this, most of the time was spent cutting the planks for the arms.

## 09/08/2025 - Attaching the servos:

The evening was spent attaching the servos to the robot. Professor Shiloh request at least one, but I ended up attaching 3 servos. One for the face, and the other ones for the shoulder and the fore-arm.
I started with the face first. Since the glue wasn't working well with the wooden plank and the servo's plastic surface, I made use of copper wiring to create a support mesh which anchored both the face, and the motor in place!

After the face was put in place alongside it's mini-servo and much wrestling, the next step was to assemble pan-tilt assembly for the 2  degree of freedom movement.

Assembling the pan-tilt wasn't hard. Using 4 size wooden drill bit, holes were made for M3 thredded bolt, which were tightened with nuts attached to their ends on the opposite side of the plank. 
The issue I faced was that 10 mm M3s were interefering with the servos (scratching the plastic casing), and I left them partially screwed to the brackets. Overall today was quite a  productive day!
