## 09/02/2025 - Fixing the Robot base and body frame:

Today was a quite long day. After trying to get around the problem of one of the motors not spinning and working according to program structure, the board and circuit installment including arduino was tested for short circuit. Towards the end the fault was found inside the Arduino board wwhich was later swapped.
