## 09/02/2025 - Fixing the Robot base and body frame:

Today was a quite long day. After trying to get around the problem of one of the motors not spinning and working according to program structure, the board and circuit installment including arduino was tested for short circuit. Towards the end the fault was found inside the Arduino board which was later swapped.

The Next step was to build a 1.5 Metre long body with physical characterics to the robot. The wooden plank from Alpine wood was used to build the backbone of the frame, and a lot of sawing, cutting, and drilling was done to manufacture the robot as we advised.
